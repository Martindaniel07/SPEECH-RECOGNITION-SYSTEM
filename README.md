This project involves the development of a speech recognition system that converts spoken language into text using Python. It leverages libraries such as SpeechRecognition, PyAudio, and optionally Google Speech API for real-time voice-to-text conversion. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how human speech can be effectively captured through a microphone and transcribed into readable text, which can then be used for command execution, transcription, or accessibility purposes. The system listens for input via the microphone, processes the audio data, and outputs the recognized words on the screen. This project helps explore important concepts such as audio sampling, signal processing, noise handling, and API integration. Speech recognition has wide-ranging applications including virtual assistants, automated transcription services, smart homes, and accessibility tools for differently-abled users. By building this project, users gain hands-on experience in Python programming, machine learning, and human-computer interaction technologies.
